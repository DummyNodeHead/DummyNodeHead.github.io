Hi, I'm ZCY, currently a junior, majoring in software engineering at ZJU School of Computer Science and Technology. Master some front-end technology, more proficient in react. Currently, I am learning ML and AI Security under the guidance of Mr. Yang Ziqi in the Network Security Lab.



I have been exposed to machine learning more or less before, and I also participated in CV scientific research training during the summer vacation of my sophomore year (although I did a little shit). But up to now there is no systematic learning of ML from scratch for me. As a result, many things are now in a state of ignorance. After thinking and planning, I entered Mr. Yang Ziqi's laboratory in early April and took this opportunity to conduct a systematic study. Personally, I am also very interested in AI Security, and I want to research and develop in this area in the future.



Front-end is also one of my usual interests. Rather than writing boring backends and algorithms (but I don't think AI is boring), I prefer to make some messy colorful things. Now I have mastered the react framework proficiently, and the mastery of js is also very good. I will post some of my own study notes in this blog. At this stage, it is mainly about ML. And I will strive for research this semester, otherwise I will run America.
